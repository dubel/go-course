/*
Write a Bubble Sort program in Go. The program
should prompt the user to type in a sequence of up to 10 integers. The program
should print the integers out on one line, in sorted order, from least to
greatest. Use your favorite search tool to find a description of how the bubble
sort algorithm works.

As part of this program, you should write a
function called BubbleSort() which
takes a slice of integers as an argument and returns nothing. The BubbleSort() function should modify the slice so that the elements are in sorted
order.

A recurring operation in the bubble sort algorithm is
the Swap operation which swaps the position of two adjacent elements in the
slice. You should write a Swap() function which performs this operation. Your Swap()
function should take two arguments, a slice of integers and an index value i which
indicates a position in the slice. The Swap() function should return nothing, but it should swap
the contents of the slice in position i with the contents in position i+1.

				s[j], s[j+1] = s[j+1], s[j]
				//swap(s, j, j+1)
			}
